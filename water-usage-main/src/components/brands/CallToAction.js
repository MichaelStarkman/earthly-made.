        As we’ve become more conscious about our purchases, we often wonder: Who makes the clothes we wear every day and in what kind of conditions? Documentaries like “The True Cost” shine a light on how the fast fashion industry depletes the earth’s resources and leverages labor to pass on a "cheap" cost to the end consumer. But our spending—and non-spending—can help make a positive difference for the people and resources involved in the making of our clothing. Each fashion brand has made it a central part of its mission to approach garment production in an ethical and transparent way that considers both people and the planet. Many of these ethical clothing brands come with third-party sustainable and ethical certifications as well.
